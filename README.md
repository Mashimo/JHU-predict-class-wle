# Prediction model for Weight Lifting Exercises
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell of 6 participants.  
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 

The goal of the project is **to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.** 
This is the "classe" variable in the data set: A - E  
* exactly according to the specification (Class A), 
* throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), 
* lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), 
* lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) 
* throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

## Project report
This report describes how I built the model, how I used cross validation, 
what I think the expected out of sample error is, and why I made the choices I did.
